# Available Shortcuts
### Smart Alarm
I have a very hetic sleep schedule where I can't always control when I go to bed so I created this alarm to help me get 7.5 hours of sleep with 15 minutes of buffer time. The shortcut is pretty simple, it schedules an alarm for tomorrow (if it is not past mid-night :)). I ran into issues where there was a lot of duplicate alarms so this shortcut checks if an alarm already exists before creating a new one. If it exists then it toggles it otherwise it creates a new alarm.

If you want to change the hours you can do it here. The time needs to be in minutes. It would be great if smart watch had this feature where it can detect when we fall asleep and schedule an alarm accordingly. Let me know if you find a watch with this feature. There is a feature request for this in the [Fitbit Community](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Product-Feedback/Alarm-based-on-set-hours-slept-eg-wake-me-up-after-8-hours/idi-p/1696221) but it's status is "Not Planned".

### RF Kill
I don't know about you but I don't like to keep the Wifi, Bluetooth or Cellular on if I'm not using it. This shortcut turns off Wifi, Bluetooth and Cellular. 

### Alarm + RF Kill
This is just the combination of **Smart Alarm** and **RF Kill**.
